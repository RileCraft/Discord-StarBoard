# Introduction
Welcome to my another project! This is a template for having starboard in multiple guilds as it stores data in a database. It is a simple starboard so you can customize it to your needs. If you encounter any bugs make sure to report to us!

# Important Notes
* All the informatiom about the handler used in this template can be found here. [Click to visit handler repo](https://github.com/RileCraft/DiscordBot-Template).
* This is for Discord.JS V13.
* You are recommended to use NodeJS V16 and above.
* This template uses **quick.db** as its default database with all the database already in async. If you want to use for eg: **quickmongo** then you can by seeing the notes for it below.

# Configuration
* You can use either `config.json` or `.env` whichever you prefer most.
* Fill the details in either of the files.
* Make sure to use NodeJS V16.
* To start the setup of the starboard for the guild, run the command `(your set prefix)setup` and then fill the details as it asks you.
